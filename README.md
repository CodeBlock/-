# dash

A toy lambda calculus implementation that will be simply typed.

## Syntax

Types aren't yet implemented, so there is no type syntax yet.

There's also no syntax for persistence, yet.

```
((λx. (λy. ($x)))(1234))       # const.
```

# License

BSD-3, but it's a toy and you probably don't want it.
